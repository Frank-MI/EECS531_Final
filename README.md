# EECS531_Final

This is the final project repository for EECS531 Computer Vision. The main target of this project is to build a 3D convolutional neural network for human action recognition. Our work mainly based on paper:

1. [3D Convolutional Neural Networks for Human Action Recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6165309/)
