    "Recognizing human actions is one of most popular computer vision method which finds mutiple applications in lots of fields such as video surveillance, customer attributes, shopping behavior analysis.\n",

    "In our final project, we consider the automated recognition of human actions in some videos. We proposed to build up a 3D CNN model for action recognition. In order to capture motion information from multiple adjacent frames, we proposed to extract features from both spatial and temporal dimensions. Based on this feature extractor, a 3D convolutional neural network will be built up. This CNN will generates multiple channels of information and performs convolution and subsampling separately. The final feature representation is obtained by conbining information from all channels."

    "## Nerual network framework\n",
    "In this project, we are going to apply [Keras](https://keras.io) as our neural network framework since it is already introduced in Homework3. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation, being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay and good for research."
